		This project, I worked with friends to produce a fast, customized Discord bot for our servers.
		We added support for serving images from image boards, reverse image searching images that user
		provides and giving wiki data when user requested.
	</p>

		From this I was able to learn the basics of Go such as functions, structs, methods and
		interfaces. I was hoping to learn a bit more about Go channels but I guess that will have to
		wait for another time.
