	<p>This is the project for my personal website.</p>
	<p>
		Originally, I planned to write it using just HTML/CSS. But after doing some research, I realized
		that being able to create <b>React</b>
		applications are very important and useful. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I learned
		<b>Javascript</b> (and ES6) and React at the same time.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the challenges I faced was just designing the website to be easy to navigate as well as
		appealing to users. Design is not something I had prior industry experience with so I had to do
		some research into designing user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. Even after figuring out the
		design, translating it to sass/css was also a learning curve I had to overcome.
